# How to Setup a Virtual Machine

This is a step-by-step guide to setting up a Virtual Machine through Oracle VirtualBox. Virtual machines are an incredible tool to use. They are efficient, cost effective, and offer a great level of flexiblity with running with virtually any Operating System out there. Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, MacOS, etc. Ultimately I was able to install and setup through Oracle VirtualBox and hopefully following this guide, you can too!
